# .gitignore for WordPress (based on original from @salcode)
#
# By default all files are ignored.  You'll need to whitelist
# any mu-plugins, plugins, or themes you want to include in the repo.
#
# To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked, use
# git update-index --assume-unchanged
#
# To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use
# git rm --cached
#
# Change Log:
#

# ignore everything in the root except the "wp-content" directory.
